All the code has been run and tested in R 2.13.1 using RStudio 0.94.110 on an Apple x86_64, darwin9.8.0 system. Packages required are pixmap, ggplot2, and gplots. A current version of R can be obtained directly from CRAN's website, http://cran.r-project.org, and packages can be installed from the CRAN repository by running the command install.packages from the R environment. Please be aware that at the beginning of the R source file, the working directory needs to be specified - setwd(".") - currently it is set to the current directory, however feel free to change it at your convenience.
